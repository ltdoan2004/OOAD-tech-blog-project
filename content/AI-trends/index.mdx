The year 2024 is predicted to witness a wave of AI and super-intelligent robots, alongside a race for satellite internet and the development of sustainable technology.

The technology field in 2024 is expected to continue the trends of generative AI and humanoid robots, but products will be more practical and specialized. Additionally, the world may see new milestones in the race for satellite internet, quantum computing, self-driving cars, and efforts to develop technology sustainably.

## The Rise of Agentic AI

Last year, generative AI assisted users in creating text, images, and videos. This year, experts believe the new trend will be Agentic AI. In this, systems are designed to independently perform complex tasks, continuously learning from input information and making decisions without human supervision.

"Imagine AI in customer service predicting user needs before giving an answer, or AI managing networks identifying potential issues and resolving them automatically, ensuring uninterrupted service," said Liz Centoni, Cisco's Chief Customer Experience Officer, to National Technology. "This will be a prominent trend in 2024, with autonomous AI and automation integrated into personal devices, IoT, robots... to perform tasks in real-world situations."

Unlike current AI tools and large language models that rely on user prompts or predefined workflows, Agentic AI empowers systems to plan and act proactively to achieve goals set by users.

> Pioneering companies have started incorporating Agentic AI into their products, such as Google with Gemini 2.0, Anthropic with the Claude model, and OpenAI is expected to launch an AI Agent platform called Operator in January 2024. According to Emergen Research, the Agentic AI market is currently estimated at approximately $30.89 billion, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31.68% from now until 2030.

## The Satellite Internet Race
Satellite internet is proving crucial for providing connectivity in conflict zones, remote areas, and hard-to-reach locations. [SpaceX's Starlink](https://vnexpress.net/chu-de/spacex-3167) currently dominates the market with 5,200 active satellites, covering dozens of countries. However, [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk)'s company will face many competitors this year.

Two-year-old [SpaceSail from China](https://www.leonarddavid.com/chinas-starlink-system-spacesail-sets-sail-with-clutter-consequences/) is attracting attention after reaching an agreement to provide satellite internet in Brazil in November 2023. SpaceSail is not the only company; China aims for a constellation of 50,000 satellites through four projects: SpaceSail with 14,000 satellites, China Satellite Network with 12,992 satellites, Lanjian Aerospace with 10,000 satellites, and GuoWang with 13,000 satellites.

Beyond China, the European Union (EU), India, Russia, and Taiwan have also expressed interest in creating their own constellations. "The future of satellite internet may be a fierce competition between the U.S., China, the EU, and Russia—major economies with the capability to manufacture, launch, and operate satellites," said Zhang Rui, a member of the Chinese market research association, to Global Times.

## Quantum Computing Reaches New Milestones

In mid-2024, the United Nations stated that 2024 will be the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology. Although not yet widespread, recent advancements, including the launch of [Google’s Willow](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/) chip, promise practical applications for quantum computing.

According to Forbes, with the ability to compute hundreds of millions of times faster than traditional computers, quantum computers have been applied to drug discovery, optimization in finance, and logistics in recent times. This year, the technology is expected to revolutionize several fields, including climate modeling, material exploration, genetics, clean energy, and encryption in the near future.

Experts also believe that quantum computing will enhance AI capabilities, enabling data processing at unprecedented speeds. Some even suggest that 2024 could mark the "Q Day," when quantum computers become powerful enough to render current encryption methods obsolete, significantly impacting privacy and security.

## Advances in Self-Driving Cars

Starting in 2024, Americans may be able to call fully autonomous Waymo vehicles through the Uber app in Atlanta and Austin, Texas. A Google-supported service is also planned to operate in Japan. Meanwhile, Amazon's Zoox is expected to provide self-driving cars in Las Vegas, San Francisco, and begin trials in Austin and Miami. Elon Musk's Tesla will also update the "Full Self-Driving" software for Model 3 and Model Y in Texas and California.

According to the WSJ, self-driving cars are expected to appear more frequently on the roads in 2024, driving the industry to exceed $400 billion by 2034. According to CMC Global, the global self-driving car market is projected to grow from $1.921 trillion in 2023 to $13.632 trillion by 2030, with a CAGR of 32.3%. Factors driving this growth include advancements in AI, machine learning systems, computer vision, and high-quality sensors for accurate operations—elements that have been lacking in self-driving cars in previous years.

However, for self-driving cars to become commonplace on the streets, they may face legal and social challenges, particularly in building user trust regarding safety.

## Sustainable Technology

Sustainable technology is considered a key trend as organizations increasingly prioritize environmentally friendly initiatives to combat climate change. This trend includes developing and using technology that reduces energy consumption, limits carbon emissions, and promotes a circular economy.

"From data centers powered by renewable energy, energy-saving devices, to AI solutions optimizing resource use, sustainable technology is redefining how businesses operate with a focus on long-term ecological balance," Simpli Learn noted.

Many major tech companies have committed to environmental protection, such as Meta, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, investing billions into clean energy. However, sustainable technology is expected to gain even more momentum in 2024 due to increasing consumer awareness, stricter government regulations, and a demand for corporate social responsibility.

> This year, companies are predicted to continue leveraging advancements in IoT, [AI](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-Artificial-Intelligence), and blockchain to enhance sustainability in supply chains, waste management, and power grids. According to Fortune, the global green and sustainable technology market is expected to grow significantly, from $20.90 billion in 2023 to $105.26 billion in 2031, with a CAGR of 22.4%.
