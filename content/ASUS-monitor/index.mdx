 >The best ASUS monitor we've tested is the [ASUS ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDM](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/asus/rog-swift-oled-pg32ucdp). It's a premium 4k, 240Hz monitor that's fantastic for a variety of uses. It uses a QD-OLED panel that displays deep blacks next to bright highlights,and makes colors look vivid for an incredible HDR viewing experience. In terms of pure gaming performance, it has a near-instant response time that results in very sharp motion, and it supports all common VRR formats to reduce screen tearing.

There are some useful extra features that make it easy to connect different devices, like HDMI 2.1 bandwidth to take full advantage of gaming consoles, and it even supports Dolby Vision. It also has a KVM switch that makes it easy to switch between different devices and use the same keyboard and mouse connected to the monitor. There are other high-end monitors that have different gaming features, like the [ASUS ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDP](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/asus/rog-swift-oled-pg32ucdp), which has a dual mode feature to boost the refresh rate to 480Hz with a 1080p resolution. There's also the [ASUS ROG Swift OLED PG27AQDP](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/asus/rog-swift-oled-pg27aqdp) available, which is another 480Hz display, but with a lower 1440p resolution than the PG32UCDM.

 Should you be looking for the best ASUS gaming monitor on a budget, they have a few good options you can choose from. One of those is the ASUS ROG Strix XG27ACS, which is a basic entry-level 1440p gaming monitor that's a good choice if you're building your first gaming setup. It doesn't have an OLED panel like the [ASUS ROG Strix OLED XG27AQDMG,](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/asus/rog-strix-oled-xg27aqdmg) so the picture quality is much worse, but that's what you have to expect for a low-cost display. It also has a lower 180Hz refresh rate, so if you want something with a higher refresh rate, you can also consider the [ASUS TUF Gaming VG259QM,](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/asus/tuf-gaming-vg259qm) which has a 280Hz refresh rate but a lower 1080p resolution.

>As for the XG27ACS, what makes it a great choice is that it has a consistently fast response time at any refresh rate and supports all common VRR formats. It even has a backlight strobing feature to reduce persistence blur, and you can use it at the same time as VRR across a wide refresh rate range, which is a nice touch for a budget-friendly monitor.

 If you're looking for a more immersive gaming experience and are willing to expand your budget, 
 
 >ASUS has some good ultrawide gaming monitors, like the ASUS ROG Swift OLED PG34WCDM. The extra horizontal screen space is ideal if you need to view more of your surroundings at once, like atmospheric or racing games. Like the [ASUS ROG Strix OLED XG27AQDMG,](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/asus/rog-strix-oled-xg27aqdmg) it has a 240Hz refresh rate, with a 3440x1440 resolution and WOLED panel.

It has the same responsive feel as the XG27AQDMG, and fast-moving objects also look very crisp. Additionally, it displays the same deep blacks next to bright highlights, but it isn't as bright as the XG27AQDMG, and colors aren't as vivid as on the [ASUS ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDM.](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/asus/rog-swift-oled-pg32ucdm) On the plus side, it also has some extra productivity features. It has a KVM switch, making it easy to multitask with different computers, and it provides up to 90W of power over USB-C, so you can charge your laptop and display an image from it using a single cable.
