## Shifting Gears from Gaming to AI: Nvidia's Strategic Transformation
Initially celebrated for its gaming chips, Nvidia has strategically redirected its focus towards the data center sector that powers the AI tech such as [large generative AI](https://www.comsoc.org/about/committees/emerging-technologies-initiatives/large-generative-ai-models-telecom-genainet) in recent years. The company experienced rapid growth during the pandemic, benefiting from a surge in gaming, increased cloud adoption, and demand from [cryptocurrency](https://www.oswego.edu/cts/basics-about-cryptocurrency#:~:text=A%20cryptocurrency%20is%20a%20digital,you%20need%20a%20cryptocurrency%20wallet.) miners for its chips. As of the financial year ending January 29, the data center chip division has surpassed 83% of [Nvidia's total revenue,](https://companiesmarketcap.com/nvidia/revenue/#:~:text=According%20to%20NVIDIA's%20latest%20financial,sale%20of%20goods%20or%20services.) marking a significant pivot in the company's business direction.
Generative AI and data processing on a massive scale rely on the capabilities of graphics processing units (GPUs) that are at the core of Nvidia data center business, specialized chips that Nvidia dominates, holding approximately 80% of the market share as per industry analysts. GPUs are meticulously engineered to manage the unique mathematical computations essential for AI operations with high efficiency. In comparison, the more widely used central processing units (CPUs) from manufacturers such as Intel are designed for a diverse array of computing tasks but lack the specialized efficiency of GPUs. For instance, OpenAI's ChatGPT is powered by thousands of [Nvidia's GPUs,](https://companiesmarketcap.com/nvidia/revenue/#:~:text=According%20to%20NVIDIA's%20latest%20financial,sale%20of%20goods%20or%20services.) underscoring the critical role these units play in the development of advanced AI technologies.

## Why GPUs are Essential for AI Computations?

There are three technical reasons that illuminate their critical importance:

> 1. GPUs are designed for parallel processing, which allows them to handle multiple computations simultaneously.
> 2. They can be scaled to match the heights of supercomputing demands.
> 3. The software stack for AI that runs on GPUs is both extensive and sophisticated.

At the core of Nvidia's AI chips lies their advanced GPU architecture. This design allows simultaneous execution (parallel processing) of thousands of threads, dramatically cutting down the time required for AI model training and complex data analysis. Moreover, [Nvidia's Tensor Cores,](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/data-center/tensor-cores/) a feature of their latest GPUs, are specifically engineered to accelerate deep learning tasks. These cores optimize the processing of tensor operations, which are crucial in neural network computations, enhancing performance and efficiency in a way that traditional CPUs cannot match.
The company's GPUs are more than just hardware; they are the backbone of a rich software ecosystem. Nvidia has developed [CUDA,](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/data-center/tensor-cores/) a parallel computing platform and [API](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api#:~:text=API%20is%20the%20acronym%20for,to%20talk%20to%20each%20other.) model that allows developers to dive deep into the GPU's capabilities. This integration of software and hardware is what sets Nvidia apart, enabling developers to write programs that leverage GPUs for a range of complex tasks far beyond simple graphics rendering. The AI prowess of Nvidia chips is further supported by a comprehensive software suite that includes cuDNN for [deep neural networks,](https://www.aibrilliance.com/course/deep-learning-course) [TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt#:~:text=TensorRT%2C%20built%20on%20the%20NVIDIA,and%20others%20on%20NVIDIA%20GPUs.) for high-performance deep learning inference, and the recently introduced AI Enterprise suite, which is a full-stack, cloud-native suite of AI and data analytics software, optimized to run on VMware vSphere with Nvidia GPUs.
In terms of raw performance, Nvidia's AI chips excel at both training - the process of building AI models - and inference - the process of applying those models to real-world data. Their ability to deliver higher performance with greater energy efficiency means that they are not only leading the current wave of AI applications but are also setting the stage for more sustainable and advanced AI development in the years to come.
In essence, Nvidia’s AI chips are not merely components; they are the driving force behind a new era of computing, providing the necessary tools for innovation and discovery. Their technical superiority lies in their ability to perform specialized tasks with unprecedented speed and efficiency, a feat that is propelling forward the frontiers of artificial intelligence.
The culmination of these factors is that GPUs outpace CPUs in executing technical computations—both quicker and with superior energy efficiency. This advantage translates to top-tier performance in AI tasks, such as training and inference, and extends to a broad spectrum of applications in accelerated computing. To put this into perspective, [Stanford's Human-Centered AI Institute](https://hai.stanford.edu/) noted in a recent publication that GPU performance has surged by approximately 7,000-fold since 2003, with the cost-effectiveness of that performance improving by about 5,600 times. GPUs have become the premier computing platform for enhancing machine learning tasks, with most of the significant AI models in the past half-decade being trained on these processors, significantly contributing to the advancements in AI.
