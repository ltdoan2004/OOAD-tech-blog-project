We still haven’t seen the “next generation of CarPlay” that Apple first announced in 2022 and continues to say on its CarPlay webpage is arriving in 2024, as MacRumors points out. And barring some spectacular surprise, it’s not coming today or tomorrow. What gives?

> So far, we’ve only seen changes like CarPlay mapping directions appearing in the instrument cluster in cars from manufacturers like Polestar, Porsche, and Lincoln. That’s even the case for vehicles like the 2024 Lincoln Nautilus, which has the screen real estate to support Apple’s vision for its dashboard-spanning infotainment software. Porsche and Aston Martin had announced their cars would be the first to get the new CarPlay, but both recently declined to give Wired a timeline for its rollout.

Other companies that Apple said would support its new CarPlay have been [noncommittal about the software](https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/7/23157963/apple-carplay-next-gen-screen-car-companies) since it was announced. Some have closed the door on full support more forcefully since then, like when Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius [told The Verge’s Nilay Patel in April](https://www.theverge.com/24140551/mercedes-benz-ola-kallenius-ev-gwagen-carplay-apple) that Apple won’t be taking over all the screens in its cars.

Outside of Apple’s initial pronouncement that so many cars would use its big CarPlay update, automakers like General Motors and Rivian have taken a stand against both it and Google’s Android Auto. That’s not a popular position, [particularly for GM](https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/4/23669523/gm-apple-carplay-android-auto-ev-restrict-access), but both have indicated it’s about having more control over their vehicles.

Despite the lukewarm reception of Apple’s ideas, the company has [continued to talk](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/17/24180353/apple-carplay-wireless-system-features) about its plans for the software. It’s just not clear what cars, if any, it will ever show up in.
